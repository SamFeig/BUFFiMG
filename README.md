# BUFFiMG
CSCI 3308 Project

BUFFiMG is an image sharing website. It allows you to upload images to then share with your
friends and the general CU community. Each image has a personal link to send to others,
but the website also allows to search the entire website by tags, so that users can search images
by topic. All of this allows the users to share images without sending the entire file, instead
uploading it over wifi once and then sending just a link to multiple other people. Our
site is also exclusive to CU students (found with a @colorado.edu email), which will build a
sense of community among users and the school.

The website uses ASP.NET Core MVC as a front end and integration layer. It is hosted on Heroku
[here](https://buffimg.herokuapp.com)

The backend is a MySQL database hosted on AWS
